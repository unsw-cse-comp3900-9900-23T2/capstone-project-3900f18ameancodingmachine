Week One
  I met my team and chose our project topic which is the Eatery Management System. We chose a scrum master and discussed our prefered roles, I chose to work on front-end as that
  is where I feel most comfortable. We also discussed the tools we could/will use for our project development.

Week Two
  We got started defining our user stories and setting up our proposal document. I wrote the 'existing systems and drawbacks' section of our proposal. This involved signing up for
  the two similar websites and mock using them as both customers and restaurants (where possible).

Week Three
  We worked on our proposal, refining our user stories and deciding on novel functionality. I made the story boards for our user stories, and in the process found a number of missing
  or redundant user stories to add/remove. I then wrote up the descriptions of the story boards and split the overview storyboard into sections based on the functionality categories.

Week Four
  We had a planning meeting. Set up Material UI front-end framework for visual elements.
  Integrated framework with existing login and home page skeleton. Structured front-end
  into separate folders for each main piece of functionality.

Week 5

Week 6
  Implemented user home page and top navigation banner. Implemented navigation routes and
  navigation elements on pages. Set up initial registration page structure.

Week 7
  Completed login/logout and register front-end routing and functionality, fixed some known bugs.
  Added user context to keep login information synced across pages. Initial design for restaurant 
  posts.
  
Week 8
  Implemented view/hide vouchers functionality. Continued work on improving the styling of pages.
  Redesigned routing pages to what was decided by team. Fixed navigation elements.

Week 9
  Set up linting on the front-end with ESLint. Reformatted and styled all the front-end code to match
  linting requirements when the automatic linting failed. Implemented the User Profile page with
  upload image functionality and added icon button to banner. Set up restaurant posts to display on
  the user profile from eateries the user is subscribed to.

Week 10
  Restructured and styled the restaurant profile page. Modified the restaurant profile so that it can be
  used for users too, hiding components that only eatery managers should have access to. Fixed a few
  bugs with routing and links. Wrote some functionalities in the report. Set up the references section,
  wrote the 3rd party functionalities and implementation challengs for the front-end parts and the APIs.
  Edited and formatted the report.
